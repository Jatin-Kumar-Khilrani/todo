- Problem-solving skills are more valuable than perfect code
- Understanding failure modes makes you a better developer

### 2. Prompt Engineering for Coding

**üî• Effective Prompting Strategies:**
```
‚ùå BAD: "Fix my code"
‚úÖ GOOD: "I'm getting this specific error: [paste exact error]. Here's my current code: [paste relevant code]. Please help me understand why this is happening and how to fix it."

‚ùå BAD: "Add AI to my app"
‚úÖ GOOD: "Add an AI-powered feature that takes a task title and returns an array of subtasks. Use Azure OpenAI API, include error handling, and show loading states to the user."

‚ùå BAD: "Deploy this"
‚úÖ GOOD: "Deploy this HTML/CSS/JS todo app to Azure Static Web Apps. I want automatic deployment from GitHub and need to integrate with a separate Azure Function App for AI features."
```

**üéØ Specific Prompt Patterns:**
- **Context Setting**: "I'm building a [type] application using [technologies]..."
- **Error Reporting**: "I'm encountering this exact error: [paste full error]..."
- **Requirement Specification**: "I need this feature to: [specific requirements]..."
- **Learning Focus**: "Please explain why [concept] works this way..."

### 3. Debugging Methodology

**üîç Systematic Debugging Approach:**
```
1. REPRODUCE: Can you consistently reproduce the error?
2. ISOLATE: What's the minimal code that causes the issue?
3. RESEARCH: What do the error messages actually mean?
4. HYPOTHESIZE: What might be causing this problem?
5. TEST: Try one fix at a time and verify results
6. DOCUMENT: Record what worked and what didn't
```

**üõ†Ô∏è Essential Debugging Tools:**
- **Browser DevTools**: Network tab, Console, Application storage
- **Azure CLI**: Resource status, logs, configuration checking
- **GitHub Actions**: Build logs, deployment status
- **curl commands**: Direct API testing without frontend interference

### 4. Incremental Development Strategy

**üìà Build in Small Steps:**
```
‚úÖ Stage 1: Basic functionality working locally
‚úÖ Stage 2: Add one feature at a time
‚úÖ Stage 3: Deploy simple version first
‚úÖ Stage 4: Add complexity after basics work
‚úÖ Stage 5: Test each integration point separately
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid These Common Mistakes:**
- Don't change multiple things simultaneously
- Don't skip testing intermediate steps
- Don't ignore warning messages
- Don't deploy without local testing

### 5. Effective Error Communication

**üìù When Asking for Help:**
```
INCLUDE:
‚úÖ Exact error message (copy-paste, don't retype)
‚úÖ Relevant code snippets (not entire files)
‚úÖ What you were trying to accomplish
‚úÖ What you expected to happen
‚úÖ What actually happened
‚úÖ Steps you've already tried

AVOID:
‚ùå "It's not working"
‚ùå Screenshots of text (copy-paste instead)
‚ùå Entire file dumps when only a section is relevant
‚ùå Vague descriptions without specific examples
```

### 6. Azure Development Best Practices

**üîß Resource Management:**
```bash
# Always check your resource status
az group list --output table
az functionapp list --resource-group YOUR-RG --output table

# Monitor costs
az consumption budget list

# Clean up resources when done
az group delete --name YOUR-RG --yes --no-wait
```

**üí∞ Cost Control Tips:**
- Use consumption pricing for Function Apps during development
- Monitor your Azure spending regularly
- Delete resources when not actively using them
- Use resource groups for easy bulk deletion

### 7. Version Control and Collaboration

**üìã Git Best Practices for Workshop:**
```bash
# Commit frequently with descriptive messages
git add .
git commit -m "Add basic todo functionality with localStorage"

# Create branches for experimental features
git checkout -b feature/ai-integration

# Keep your main branch deployable
git checkout main
git merge feature/ai-integration
```

### 8. Learning Documentation

**üìö Keep a Learning Journal:**
```
DAILY LOG TEMPLATE:
- What I tried to build today
- What errors I encountered
- How I solved each problem
- What I learned about [technology/concept]
- Questions to research further
- Resources that helped me

WORKSHOP REFLECTION:
- Biggest challenges faced
- Most surprising discoveries
- Skills developed
- Architecture decisions and why
- What I would do differently next time
```

### 9. Resource Management and Troubleshooting

**üîç Essential Commands for Debugging:**
```bash
# Check Function App status
az functionapp show --name YOUR-FUNCTION-APP --resource-group YOUR-RG

# View Function App logs
az functionapp logs tail --name YOUR-FUNCTION-APP --resource-group YOUR-RG

# Test Function App directly
curl -X POST "https://YOUR-FUNCTION-APP.azurewebsites.net/api/plantask" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"taskTitle":"Test task"}'

# Check Static Web App deployment status
az staticwebapp show --name YOUR-STATIC-APP --resource-group YOUR-RG
```
